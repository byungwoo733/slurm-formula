slurm
=====

Install the SLURM client, node, controller or database daemon.

.. note::

   The original version was tested under CentOS 7.  The port to
   Unbuntu 16.04 was a considerable change, including removal of the
   code that sets up a mariadb servers.  It should still work under Centos 7.
   
   See the full `Salt Formulas installation and usage instructions
